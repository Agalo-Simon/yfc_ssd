            <p>We live in a society that is battling for the attention of teenagers. Teenagers are a billion dollar industry. They have an unquenchable lust for pleasures of all kinds.
              YFC reaches young people everywhere, working together with the local church and other likeminded partners to raise up lifelong followers of Jesus who lead by their godliness in lifestyle, devotion to the Word of God and prayer, passion for sharing the love of Christ and commitment to social involvement.</p>

                    <p>We believe that every kid matters. We seek to empower and equip teams of Christian students to engage their friends so that every young
                      person will have the opportunity to make an informed decision to be a follower of Jesus Christ and become a part of the local Church. We trust Holy Spirit to lead
                       students with the same power & love as adults in the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18-20; Matt. 9:36-37; Heb. 10:24-25; Col. 1:28-29)
